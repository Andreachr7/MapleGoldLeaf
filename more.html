        <p>There will only be 66 Maple Gold Leafs ever created. We wanted to create a premium digital asset where its users contribute to the value of each item through their personal experiences.</p>
        <p>Built to enable people to help each other -  we believe those that have struggled with mental health have an innate empathy to help people going through something similar.</p>
        <p>Discouraged with the traditional methods of treating mental health -  We wanted to create a network where people can share alternative methods that have practically helped them.</p>
        <p>The Maple Mental Movement is not meant to replace your mental health practitioner, but rather to supplement your mental health journey. Maple Mental Movement cannot be held responsible for the experiences shared by the participating network.</p>
        <p>Censorship done via network economics. We trust that the experiences more valued by the community will sell for a higher price, and the experiences that aren’t helpful will not have the same economic compensation for their contribution.</p>
